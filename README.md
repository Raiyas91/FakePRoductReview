# FakeProductReview
In the current scenario, the data on the web is growing exponentially. Social media is generating a large amount of data such as reviews, comments, and customer’s opinions on a daily basis. This huge amount of user generated data is worthless unless some mining operations are applied to it. As there are a number of fake reviews so opinion mining technique should incorporate Spam detection to produce a genuine opinion.

My proposed technique includes Ontology, Geo location and IP address tracking, Spam words Dictionary using Naïve Bayes, Brand only review detection and tracking account used.
